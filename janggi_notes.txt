Janggi
------------------------------------------------------------------
Janggi, sometimes called Korean chess, is a strategy board game
popular in Korea. The game was derived from xiangqi (Chinese
chess) of China and is very similar to it, including the starting
position of the pieces, and the 9×10 gameboard, but without the
xiangqi "river" dividing the board horizontally in the middle.

Janggi is played on a board nine lines wide by ten lines long.
The game is sometimes fast paced due to the jumping cannons and
the long-range elephants, but professional games most often last
over 150 moves and so are typically slower than those of Western
chess.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Board Description:
------------------------------------------------------------------
    90 intersections of 9 vertical files and 10 horizontal rows.

    A palace is 3 lines by 3 lines (9 positions) in the centre of
    their side of the board, against the black edge of the board.
    An X runs through the center of the Palace such that there are
    four diagonal lines outwards from the center.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Pieces
------------------------------------------------------------------
General:

    Starts at the central intersection of the palace and can
    NEVER leave the Palace.

    Can move one step per turn along marked board lines
    to any of the nine points within the palace.

    By "marked board lines", we mean you can only jump
    diagonally when there is a line allowing such a move.

    We are ignoring the bikjang/xixangqi rules for this
    version of the game - it is not illegal for generals to face
    each other, and players not moving a general away when facing
    the other general does NOT result in a draw.

    If there is no move for the general to make without getting
    into check or checkmate but safe to stand still, the person
    can pass their turn.

Guards (3 points):

    Start to the left and right of the general on the first rank.

    Move in the same way as the General (one space per time, along
    the marked lines) and can also not leave the Palace.

Horses (5 points):

    Can move one step orthogonally then one step diagonally
    outward, with no jumping through intervening pieces.

    We are ignoring the possible transposing with adjacent
    elephants during the initial board setup.

Elephants (3 points):

    Begin the game to the left and right of the guards.

    They move one point orthogonally followed by two
    points diagonally away from their starting point,
    ending on the opposite corner of a 2x3 rectangle. Like
    the horse, they cannot jump through intervening pieces.

Chariots (13 points):

    The chariots begin in the corners of the board.

    Can move and capture in a straight line either horizontally
    or vertically, AND can move along the diagonal lines
    inside either Palace, but only in a straight line.

Cannons (7 points):

    Placed on the row behind the soldiers and directly in front
    of the horses.

    Requirement for moving that there must another piece
    horizontally or vertically. The jump can be performed
    over any distance provided that there is exactly one and
    only one piece (friendly or non-friendly) anywhere between
    the original position and the target position. The same
    rules apply for them being able to capture pieces - there
    must be one piece between the cannon and the piece to be
    captured.

    Additionally, they can move and capture along the diagonal
    lines within the Palace, provided there is an intervening
    piece in the center, meaning that this can only happen
    if the cannon is at corner space in the Palace.

    Cannons MUST jump in order to move AND capture.

    Cannons CANNOT jump over other cannons, friendly or otherwise.

    A cannon CANNOT capture another cannon.

Soldiers (2 points):

    Five total soldiers, placed on alternating points, one row
    back from the center row.

    They can move and capture one point either straight forwards
    or sideways. They cannot move diagonally or backwards.

    Once soldiers reach the end of the board, they may only
    move sideways (no promotion)

    Soldiers may also move one point diagonally forward within the
    enemy palace (but still are not allowed to move backwards).
------------------------------------------------------------------
General Game Rules:
------------------------------------------------------------------
    The game is won by checkmating the opposing general.

    Check is defined as a situation where if the player passed
    their turn, their general would be captured on their
    opponents next turn.

    A stalemate is NOT a draw. If a player has no legal moves
    available, they MUST pass their turn.

    If there is no move for the general to make without getting
    into check or checkmate but safe to stand still, the player
    can voluntarily pass their turn.

    Once neither player can move legally, or if neither player
    can win due to their number of pieces remaining, the game
    ends in a draw.
